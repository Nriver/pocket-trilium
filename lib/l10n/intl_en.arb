  "firstLoadInstructions": "First load may take about 5 to 10 minutes, please be patient :) \n\nDuring the first load, do not exit the app to avoid interrupting the process. You can take a look at the instructions below in the meantime.\n\nOnce loading is complete, the app will automatically transition to the main graphical interface.\n\nBy default, Pocket Trilium stores its data inside the app container. If you uninstall the app, the data will be deleted as well.\n\nIf you already have Trilium data on your computer, you can directly copy the 'trilium-data' folder from your computer to your phone's internal storage. Then, with Pocket Trilium open, use the system's file manager to copy the data to the /0/home/pocket directory inside the Pocket Trilium container. After restarting the app, it will fetch your data from /0/home/pocket/trilium-data, without the need for re-initialization or synchronization. If the data is not automatically recognized after copying, try restarting the app or check the file path.\n\nThanks to Cateners for the Tiny Computer project: https://github.com/Cateners/tiny_computer\nThanks to Zadam for creating the excellent Trilium Notes: https://github.com/zadam/trilium\nThanks to all contributors in the Trilium community.\nAnd thanks to my back, which has endured the long hours of sitting as a coder :) \n\nIf you like this project, feel free to give the repository a star, and we greatly appreciate your sponsorship and support~\nhttps://github.com/Nriver/pocket-trilium",
