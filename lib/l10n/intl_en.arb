  "firstLoadInstructions": "The first launch may take approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Please be patient :)\n\nOnce loading is complete, the app will automatically transition to the main graphical interface.\n\nBy default, Trilium stores its data inside the app. Uninstalling the app will delete all data. To ensure persistence, we recommend granting storage permissions and manually creating a folder named \"trilium-data\" in the root directory of your phone's internal storage. Trilium will then save data directly to this folder.\n\nIf you already have Trilium data from a desktop client, you can simply copy the \"trilium-data\" folder to the root of your phone's internal storage to use it immediately, skipping the initial synchronization. If the data is not detected after copying, try restarting the app.\n\nPlease do not exit the app during the initial loading process.\n\nWhile waiting, you can click the button below to request storage permissions in advance (recommended).\n\nIf you don't need persistent storage for now, you may choose not to grant file permissions.\n\nSpecial thanks to Cateners' Tiny Computer project: https://github.com/Cateners/tiny_computer\nThanks to Zadam for creating the wonderful Trilium Notes: https://github.com/zadam/trilium\nThanks to the entire Trilium community\nAnd thanks to my lower back (for enduring all those long coding sessions :) )\n\nIf you enjoy this project, please consider giving it a Star on GitHub.
