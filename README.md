# Pocket Trilium

**Run Trilium on Android.**

![logo](docs/logo.png)

This project is inspired by and heavily modified from the [Cateners/tiny_computer](https://github.com/Cateners/tiny_computer) project.

## Overview

Pocket Trilium allows you to run the powerful [Trilium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) app on Android devices. While originally based on the [tiny_computer](https://github.com/Cateners/tiny_computer) project, this version has undergone significant modifications to better suit my needs.

## Credits

A big thank you to the [Cateners/tiny_computer](https://github.com/Cateners/tiny_computer) project for the foundational work. The initial code for this project was based on the following commit: [6425e04](https://github.com/Cateners/tiny_computer/tree/6425e0443efce97b9882c76294bd4271daf39996).

While I’ve made many changes to adapt the project to my use case, I decided to start a new repository instead of maintaining it as a fork, since the goals of this project diverged significantly from the original.
